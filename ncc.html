NCC Group has created a few challenges over the years that are good starting points for getting into relatively niche areas of information security. Here can be found analysis of several of the standouts.

group has produced top-notch <a href="https://microcorruption.com">hacking challenges</a> that are a boon to anyone looking to become more familiar with that subject area. The original set has been out for nearly a decade and is worth reviewing to get a baseline understanding of firmware reverse engineering and modern<label for="sn-1" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

exploit development. They also announced a <a href="https://research.nccgroup.com/2022/10/31/check-out-our-new-microcorruption-challenges/">new series</a> of six challenges on October 31<sup>st</sup>, 2022. The latter set is interesting because of its adjacency to hardware security—invaluable for those wishing to learn how to exploit flaws in secure boot implementations or try their hand at black box analysis against secure element APIs.</p>

	      These challenges highlight types of vulnerabilities that NCC Group’s Hardware and Embedded Systems practice have discovered in real products.

<p>Only two writeups are published for the new series, likely because only a few dozen people on Earth have working exploits at the time of writing. The following pages comprise the first complete guide available on the internet.<label for="sn-4" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
